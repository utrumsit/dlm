# DLM Configuration
# Place this file at: ~/.config/dlm/config.py (recommended)
# Or in your library root (legacy, not recommended for cloud-synced libraries)
#
# The local path (~/.config/dlm/) is preferred because:
#   - API keys and tokens stay on the machine, not in the cloud
#   - No timeouts from OneDrive/iCloud "Files On-Demand"
#   - Each machine gets its own config (no hostname dict needed)

# Joplin Web Clipper
# Get token from: Joplin -> Settings -> Web Clipper -> Advanced Options
JOPLIN_TOKEN = ""
JOPLIN_API_URL = "http://localhost:41184"
JOPLIN_NOTEBOOK_NAME = "Digital Library Notes"

# AI Reading Assistant (Google Gemini)
#
# Option 1 (recommended): OAuth — uses your Google account, no key management
#   Create OAuth credentials at https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
#   (Create project → Enable "Generative Language API" → OAuth Client ID → Desktop app)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = ""
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = ""
#   Then run: dlm-auth
#
# Option 2: API key (simpler but rate-limited on free tier)
#   Get a key from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
GOOGLE_API_KEY = ""

# Skim PDF Reader
SKIM_APP_PATH = "/Applications/Skim.app"
